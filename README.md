# Automated-Car-Coal-Project-Final-
🚗 Project Showcase: Automated Car using ESP32 & Arduino with Bluetooth Control 🔧📱
I’m excited to share our latest project — a Bluetooth-controlled automated car built using ESP32, Arduino Uno, and a mobile app interface.
This project was developed as part of our course CSC-205L: Computer Organization & Assembly Language at Department of Computer Science, UET Lahore , and it gave us hands-on experience with microcontrollers, wireless communication, embedded C programming, and real-time motor control.
🔍 What it does:
 The car can be wirelessly controlled via a smartphone using Bluetooth commands. The ESP32 receives input from the mobile app, passes it to Arduino which then drives the motors through an L298N motor driver. It supports movements like Forward, Backward, Left, and Right — all controlled in real-time!
💡 Key Technologies Used:
ESP32 for Bluetooth communication
Arduino Uno for motor logic
L298N Motor Driver
Embedded C (Arduino IDE)
Mobile App for control interface
🎯 What We Learned:
Interfacing microcontrollers and motor drivers
Serial communication between ESP32 and Arduino
Real-time control logic with C programming
Practical application of IoT and robotics fundamentals
